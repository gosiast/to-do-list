# to-do-list

This is a JavaScript project where I built a To-do list!

README
The single most important part of your portfolio project is the README.md found at the root of your project (GitHub will render it automatically on your repo page if it exists). It's the first thing that hiring managers will see when they click through to your project.

In many cases, hiring managers won't even take the time to look at your code, let alone clone and run it. The README.md is your chance to "wow" them and convince them that you're worth their time.

SECTIONS OF A GOOD README
A good README.md has a few sections:

Title
Description
"Why?" (Motivation/Goal/Problem to solve)
Quick Start
Usage
Contributing
We will look at each of these in detail, but for now, let's just get a good title.

TITLE SECTION
Give your project a good name! Don't name it "project", "API server", or "test app". Give it a name that's unique and memorable. Personality is useful here.

MARKDOWN FORMATTING
Use this Markdown Reference to help you format your README. Your title should be an H1 (heading 1, the largest heading). You should then use H2s and H3s to organize the rest of your README into a nice hierarchy.

Submit the link to your project's GitHub repo after you've added a title using an H1 heading.

DESCRIPTION
Use a couple of sentences to explain exactly what your project is. Don't be vague. Don't be generic. Try to say it in as simple a way as possible.

At all stages of the job search, refrain from minimizing or diminishing your work! Don't say:

This is just a toy app
This is just a test project
This is for practice
Give your projects the respect they deserve. Do not say "just". Say something like:

This is zipzod! A command-line tool for zipping and unzipping files with an ultra low memory footprint.

EXAMPLES
Wrapper of rabbitmq/amqp091-go that provides reconnection logic and sane defaults

The fun, functional and stateful way to build terminal apps. A Go framework based on The Elm Architecture. Bubble Tea is well-suited for simple and complex terminal applications, either inline, full-window, or a mix of both.

IMAGES
If it makes sense, include a demo of your project in gif or video form! You can embed a GIF of your project "doing the thing" here. Bubble Tea's repo is a great example of this:
